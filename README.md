# bignum

This is the code that goes with my blog series on [Making a bignum library for fun](https://austinhenley.com/blog/bignum1.html).

I've always wondered how some systems support numbers of any size, far beyond 64-bits, actually work. 

So, I built my own and wrote up what I learned. Much more to come!
